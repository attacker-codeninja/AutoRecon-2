# AutoRecon
Just a shell script I wrote to make recon easier for bug bounties. 

Requirements:
In order for the script to work, you need:
- Nuclei
- Subfinder
- Amass
- Httprobe 

Installation:
- Ensure that you have the git command installed 
- Run the command: git clone https://github.com/evanRubinsteinIT/AutoRecon.git
- Navigate into the installed folder, and run the command: chmod +x AutoRecon.sh
- In order to finally use the script, run the command ./AutoRecon.sh
